             <p class="writeup"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current,
                 if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
             <p class="writeup2">“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
                 transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.  I signed up for <br>
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12 <br>
                  weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br>
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."  </p>

                    <p class="writeup6">  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br>
                        some structure from professionals <br>
                         who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br>
                         enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful
                         things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br>
                         disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait 
                         long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br>
                         my learning to the next level in a way <br> that
                         no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>
                         interviews as an example of my <br>developent experience. It
                         certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple<br>
                         offers.100% recommend! ” </p>

                         themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from  <br>
                         their experiences was easy.</p>

                         program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>
                          myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br>
